Where to use JAVASCRIPT ...

In HTML, JAVASCRIPT code is inseted between <script> and </script> tags.

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>

--> Scripts can be placed in <body> and <head> section of an HTML page.
--> Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed,
    because script interpretation slows down the display.

External JavaScript

--> Scripts can also be placed in external files
--> JavaScript files have the file extension .js
--> To use an external script, put the name of the script file in 
    the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:
    <script src="myScript.js"></script>

Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

--> It separates HTML and code
--> It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
--> Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
